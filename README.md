## 🛠️ Installation & Setup

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd SouthEastArchers
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables:**
   Copy the example environment file and update it with your settings:
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   ```

3. **Install dependencies:**
   Using the management script (installs both Python and Node.js dependencies):

   python manage.py install
   ```

4. **Initialize the database:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py db upgrade
   ```

5. **Seed roles and permissions:**
   ```bash
   python manage.py rbac seed
   ```

6. **Create an admin user:**

   ```

## 🏃 Running the Application

### Development Mode
Runs both the Flask development server and Vite asset watcher:
```bash
python manage.py dev
```
- Flask: http://localhost:5000
- Vite: http://localhost:5173 (Asset hot-reloading)

### Individual Servers
- **Flask only:** `python manage.py runserver`
- **Vite only:** `npm run dev`

### Scheduled Tasks
Run scheduled tasks (membership expiry, low credits reminders):
```bash
python manage.py schedule run
```
For production, set up a cron job to run this command every minute.

## 🔐 Role Based Access Control (RBAC)

The application uses a fine-grained RBAC system for security.

### Key Concepts

- **Permissions:** Granular actions (e.g., `members.read`, `events.create`, `payments.approve`)
- **Roles:** Collections of permissions (e.g., `Admin`, `Content Manager`, `Membership Manager`)
- **Users:** Users are assigned roles, granting them all associated permissions

### Default Roles

| Role | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Admin | Full access to all features |
| Membership Manager | Manage members, memberships, and approve payments |
| Content Manager | Manage news, events, and shoots |
| Member | Standard member access |

### Implementation

- **Models:** `Role` and `Permission` in `app/models/rbac.py`
- **Decorators:** Use `@permission_required("perm.name")` in routes to enforce access
- **Service:** `RBACService` for managing roles and permissions

## ⌨️ CLI Commands (`manage.py`)

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `python manage.py dev` | Run development servers (Flask + Vite) |
| `python manage.py install` | Install Python and Node.js dependencies |
| `python manage.py db upgrade` | Apply database migrations |
| `python manage.py user create` | Create a new user (add `--admin` for admin) |
| `python manage.py test run` | Run the test suite |
| `python manage.py test coverage` | Run tests with coverage report |
| `python manage.py lint all` | Run linting and formatting (Ruff) |
| `python manage.py assets build` | Build production assets |
| `python manage.py schedule run` | Run due scheduled tasks |
| `python manage.py stats` | Show application statistics |
| `python manage.py rbac seed` | Seed default roles and permissions |
| `python manage.py clean` | Remove cache and temporary files |

Run `python manage.py --help` for a full list of commands.

## ⚙️ Environment Variables

Key environment variables in `.env`:

| Variable | Description | Default |
|----------|-------------|---------|
| `FLASK_ENV` | Application environment | `development` |
| `SECRET_KEY` | Flask secret key | (required) |
